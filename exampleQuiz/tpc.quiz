  <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/we-are-learning-less-about-trumps-tax-plan-not-more">Trump&#8217;s tax plan</a> would collapse the current seven brackets, which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, into three brackets: 12, 25, and 33 percent. Trump would use the same tax brackets as outlined in <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/ryan-proposes-big-tax-cuts-business-and-investors-moves-towards-cash-flow-tax">Speaker Ryan and the House Republican&#8217;s tax proposal</a>.

2) How would Trump&#8217;s tax plan change the percentage of Americans not paying individual income taxes (the 47 percent Mitt Romney referred to in 2012)?
  - Decrease it
  * Increase it
  - Leave it unchanged

  Trump&#8217;s tax plan would <a target="_blank" href = "">significantly increase</a> the percentage of households that pay no income tax, primarily because he would quadruple the <a target="_blank" href = "">standard deduction</a>. However, as we note in our video &#8220;<a target="_blank" href = "">Who doesn&#8217;t pay federal taxes</a>?&#8221; most people who pay no income tax work and thus pay payroll taxes, and virtually everyone pays at least some tax, such as sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, and other products.


3) Which households (grouped by income) would benefit the most from Donald Trump&#8217;s tax plan?
  - The bottom 20 percent
  - The middle 20 percent
  - The top 1 percent
  * The top 0.1 percent 
  - Everyone would get roughly the same huge tax cut
  (image) img/img3.jpg  

  Trump&#8217;s tax plan would cut taxes for households across the income spectrum, but the largest benefits&mdash;in both dollar and percentage terms&mdash;would <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/how-would-trumps-tax-cuts-affect-different-taxpayers">go to the highest-income taxpayers</a>. Trump&#8217;s tax proposals for eliminating the estate tax, reforming business taxes, and cutting individual income tax rates all benefit the wealthiest taxpayers the most.

4) How would Trump&#8217;s tax proposals affect the federal government&#8217;s debt?
  - Reduce it
  * Increase it
  - Leave it roughly unchanged
  (image) img/img4.jpg  

  Based on our analysis of Trump&#8217;s original tax proposal, he would <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trump-would-slash-taxes-top-01-percent-average-13-million-add-nearly-10-trillion-debt">reduce federal revenue by $9.5 trillion</a> over the next decade and add $11.2 trillion to the debt, including interest costs. While his new plan has a higher top individual income tax rate than his first plan, it&#8217;s still a substantial tax cut. Some of the proposals, such as limiting the value of some itemized deductions, would increase revenue but would not raise nearly enough to offset the cost of his proposed cuts.

5) True or false: Trump&#8217;s proposed tax cuts are the larger than those passed by President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush?

  * True
  - False
  (image) img/img5.jpg  

  Trump would cut revenues by 4.0 percent of GDP, nearly <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/trumps-tax-plan-twice-costly-reagans">twice the size of the Reagan tax cuts (2.1 percent of GDP) and almost three times the size of the</a> Bush tax cuts (1.4 percent of GDP).

6) Which households (grouped by income) would benefit the most from Hillary Clinton&#8217;s tax proposals?
  - The bottom 20 percent
  - The middle 20 percent
  - The top 1 percent
  * The top 0.1 percent
  (image) img/img6.jpg   

  Under Clinton&#8217;s proposals, <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/how-would-clintons-tax-proposals-affect-different-taxpayers">the top 0.1 percent</a> would see an average tax increase of nearly $520,000. The increase would mostly result from her proposed 4 percent surtax on incomes over $5 million and a &#8220;Buffett rule&#8221; that would impose a minimum tax on people with income over $1 million.

7) Roughly how much of Clinton&#8217;s total tax increases are paid by the top 1 percent of households?
  - 1 percent 
  - 50 percent
  * 75 percent
  - 100 percent
  (image) img/img7.jpg  

  <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals">The top 1 percent of households</a> <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/secretary-clintons-tax-plan/secretary-clintons-tax-proposals-baseline-current-law-1">would pay about 78 percent</a> of Clinton&#8217;s proposed tax increases. Low- and middle-income households would also see their taxes go up a little due to Clinton&#8217;s proposed business tax hikes.

8) Would Clinton&#8217;s tax plan raise any of the current seven income tax rates?
  * No
  - Yes
  (image) img/img8.jpg  

  Clinton does not propose increasing any current tax rates. <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/clinton-and-sanders-take-two-different-paths-taxing-rich">Instead</a>, she&#8217;d raise taxes with a new 4 percent &#8220;surcharge&#8221; on income over $5 million, create a new minimum tax (the &#8220;Buffett rule&#8221;) on people with income over $1 million, and limit the value of specified tax exemptions and deductions.

9) Who gets a tax cut under Clinton&#8217;s tax plan?
  - Low-income households
  - Middle-income households
  - Both low-income and middle-income households
  * Only special groups like family caregivers
  (image) img/img9.jpg  

  Clinton has <a target="_blank" href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/hillary-clinton-would-raise-taxes-high-income-households-11-trillion-over-10-years">proposed new tax credits</a> for family caregivers and households with high out-of-pocket medical expenses, which would lower taxes for qualifying households. However, the Clinton campaign has promised that the candidate will propose tax cuts for low- and middle-income households later in the campaign.

10) How would Clinton&#8217;s tax proposals affect the federal government&#8217;s debt?
  * Reduce it
  - Increase it
  - Leave it roughly unchanged 
  (image) img/img10.jpg  

  Clinton&#8217;s tax proposals would shave about $1.2 trillion off the nation&#8217;s debt over the next 10 years, only about 4 percent of GDP by the end of the period.
