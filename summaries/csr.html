						<h1>Corporate Social Responsibility: A Summary</h1>

					</header>
					<p>According to Business News Daily, businesses that practice social responsibility aim to improve communities, the economy, or the environment. These businesses self regulate in the hopes of being socially accountable, so that employees feel better about working for that company, and potential customers feel better spending their money there.</p>
					<p>There are four ways that corporations can practice social responsibility: environmental efforts, philanthropy, ethical labor practices, and volunteering. These are pretty self-explanatory, but surprisingly not really self-evident to many companies. Let’s start with some positive examples.</p>
					<p>Take Lego, every child’s favorite buildable toy. They’ve invested millions into reducing the environmental impact of their packaging, both using more sustainable materials as well as investing in alternative energy. For such a large company to take a stand on something environmental like this is huge. Amazon is actually similar to Lego in terms of environmental efforts, but falls way, way short of the mark in all other practices. For example, Jeff Bezos is the, if not one of the, richest persons on the planet; however, Amazon’s philanthropy is practically non-existent. Their labor practices are absolutely horrible as well, considering that even with the Covid-19 pandemic, the absurdity of what their warehouse workers are being asked to do is beyond all rational thought.</p>
