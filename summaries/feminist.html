						<h1>Feminist Ethics: A Summary</h1>
						<p class="info">I Don't Feel Comfortable Making a Witty Comment on This One</p>
					</header>
					<p>Feminist ethics are a relatively recent philosophy that’s really gained traction in the last couple of years. From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, feminist ethics aims “to understand, criticize, and correct” the binary view of gender, the privilige historically available to men, and/or the ways that views about gender maintain oppressive social orders or practices that harm others, especially girls and women who historically have been subordinated. This might seem like a niche group, especially when it comes to discussing corporate social responsibility, but even though it’s not explicitly listed as a way corporations can practice social responsibility, I would still argue it’s incredibly important for them to take a stand on these types of issues.</p>
					<p>The American government was established in a very different time, a time where it was normalized to discriminate against women, however wrong that was, and it’s been somewhat slow to recognize that there are literally no reasons as to why they should not be completely equal to men. Therefore, where government is slow, corporations can set the tone, considering they practically run countries as much as governments do nowadays. If a company consistently advocates for equality in the workplace, they are doing the necessary work towards creating a better culture, and properly correcting the ways that gender has played an oppressive role in the past.</p>
